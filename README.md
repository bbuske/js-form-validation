# JS Form Validation with HTML, CSS, JS & Bootstrap
This is just a very basic example, using HTML, CSS and JS, along with some Bootstrap. It checks if all fields are filled out, performs basic checks to make sure the provided email address meets requirements and checks if the passwords entered, match.

Feel free to use this, reuse it or modify, but be nice and mention me as the original author.
